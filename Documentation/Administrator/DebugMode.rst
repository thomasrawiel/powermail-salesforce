Debug mode
===

Depending on how you included the extension's configuration you have 2 options:

A) via Constants editor/ TypoScript Constants
---

.. figure:: ../Images/Configuration/ConstantEditor.jpg
   :class: with-shadow
   :alt: Constant Editor settings
   :width: 600px

   Use the constant editor to enable debug mode (Don't forget your email address!)



B) via Site Settings
---


.. figure:: ../Images/Configuration/SiteSettings.jpg
    :class: with-shadow
    :alt: Site settings
    :width: 600px

    Use the site settings to enable debug mode (Don't forget your email address!)
